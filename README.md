- Configurable crawl depth and URL limits
- Support for path inclusion/exclusion patterns
- Sitemap integration for efficient crawling
- Handles both internal and external links

#### **[Firecrawl Web Scraping](./pipelines/firecrawl_scrape.py)**
- Extracts content from specific URLs
- Multiple output formats (markdown, HTML, text)
- Main content extraction to filter out navigation, ads, etc.
- Custom tag inclusion/exclusion
- Mobile device emulation
- Ad blocking capabilities

#### **[Firecrawl URL Mapping](./pipelines/firecrawl_map.py)**
- Discovers all URLs on a website
- Search functionality to find specific URLs
- Sitemap integration
